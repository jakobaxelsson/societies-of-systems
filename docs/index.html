One of the most important trends in current society is the <em>digitization</em> of almost every human activity. This means that activities that used to be manual are taken over by technical systems and in particular by software. Human activities are thus <em>automated</em> by systems, and those systems do not only become more complex than previous generations, but also need to be more intelligent to take over human tasks.</p>
<p>However, it is not only singular human activities that are automated, but entire workflows, and this leads to the formation of loosely coupled systems-of-systems. Whereas the singular automated systems can correspond to the activities performed by one person, the system-of-systems correspond to many persons. Eventually, as the scale of those systems-of-systems grows, they do not any more correspond to groups of people, but to entire societies.</p>
<p>The title of this site, <em>societies of systems</em>, has been carefully selected to match one of the main hypothesis underlying this investigation. This hypothesis is that the way human societies are organized gives many clues to how well-functioning systems-of-systems need to be built.</p>
