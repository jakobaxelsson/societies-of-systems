Here, I will make an initial characterization of this analogy.</description><author>Jakob Axelsson</author><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true"></guid></item><item><title>Digitization: An introduction</title><link>posts/2016-01-20-digitization-an-introduction.html</link><description>This post explains some core aspect of digitalization, including underlying trends, benefits, and challenges.</description><author>Jakob Axelsson</author><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jan 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true"></guid></item><item><title>System-of-systems challenges</title><link>posts/2016-01-18-system-of-systems-challenges.html</link><description>This post explains some key definitions related to systems-of-systems, and provides an overview of challenges in the area.</description><author>Jakob Axelsson</author><pubDate>Mon, 18 Jan 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true"></guid></item></channel></rss>
